# FriendFinder

Built a compatibility-based "Friend Finder" application -- basically a dating app. This is a full-stack site  that will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

Using Heroku for hosting
